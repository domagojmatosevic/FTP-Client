TCP notes
https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc793
1. INTRODUCTION
- intended for use as a highly reliable host-to-host protocol between hosts in 
  packet-switched computer communication networks, and in interconnected systems of such 
  networks

1.1 Motivation
- providing means of interconnecting computer networks
  and to provide standard interprocess communication protocols
  which can support a broad range of applications
- TCP is connection-oriented, end-to-end reliable protocol 
- the TCP should be able to operate above a wide spectrum of communication systems
  ranging from hard-wired connections to packet-switched or circuit-switched networks
